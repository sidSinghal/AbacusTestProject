# AbacusTestProject

## Steps to run the project
1. Clone the git repository on the local system
2. Create MySQL database using the database.sql file in the /resources directory
3. Navigate to the project folder and open terminal
4. Run "mvn spring-boot:run" command
5. Launch Postman app and hit the endpoints: 
    * Get: http://localhost:8080/test/persons/{id}
    * Put: http://localhost:8080/test/persons/{id}
    * Delete: http://localhost:8080/test/persons/{id}
    * Post: http://localhost:8080/test/persons

## Deployment (jar vs war)
A JAR is a Java Archive, it is used to aggregate multiple files into a single file. A JAR file would consist of Java classes and EJB modules. It allows JRE to deploy entire application including the classes and the associated resources.

A WAR file is a Web Application Archive, it is specifically used for web applications. A WAR file would only contain files related to web application. It allows testing and deploying web applications easily, and it contains servlet, JSP, XML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Not all the servers deploy a .jar file for a web application. Spring Boot comes with an embedded Tomcat server which can deploy both kinds of file. 

## Deploying application on server (tomcat)
Spring Boot provides a standalone application and comes with many embedded tools. It has an embedded Tomcat server which deploys the application on its own, we just have to run the command "mvn spring-boot:run". To build a deployment file run "mvn clean install" and it would generate a WAR or a JAR file as specified in the pom.xml file. Once a file is generated, just move it to tomcat or any server's /webapps folder and start the server and launch URL, the application will work.  

## Securing API endpoints
Securing the endpoint is extremely important in the production environment as our whole business would depend on it. The best way to secure the endpoints are
* Using HTTPS: Data could be easily stolen by man-in-the-middle-attack if unsecured transfer protocol is, like HTTP, is used. Getting a TSL certificate to make the endpoints secure would avoid those attacks.
* Using Authentication: By applying a strong authentication method like OAuth or OAuth2 with a token expiry would be another good idea to secure the endpoints to avoid unauthorized access to it.
* Validating Inputs: By validating inputs to enter only the correctly formatted data in the application would avoid attacks like SQL injection and would also avoid storing garbage data in the database.
* Tools: By using tools, like Metasploit, would help us detect any vulnerabilities in our APIs. It would also tell us if our API would give away any application-specific technology information.

## Monitoring Endpoints
Using the Spring Boot Actuator we can monitor the endpoints. It provides us with many endpoints to monitor, like /health, /metrics, /info, /prometheus etc. Monitoring these endpoints helps us in maintaining the application.
* The /health endpoint is used to monitor the health of the application. It basically tells us if the application is running in a healthy state, i.e if there is any connectivity issue or if the application is down for some reason.
* The /metrics endpoint gives us information about the JVM, OS, and other application-level metrics. When we enable it, it gives us information about memory, threads, processors, classes loaded, classes unloaded etc.
* The /prometheus endpoint is another very useful tool provided by Spring Boot. Once the API endpoints are exposed, it would collect the metrics by scraping the endpoints regularly.

## Autoscaling a Spring Boot application
The Actuator library provided by Spring Boot can expose metrics under /actuator/metrics endpoint. This would provide us with a lot of information about JVM, CPU metrics, number of requests coming in. A dedicated Jenkins pipeline is responsible for monitoring the applicationâ€™s metrics by polling the endpoint /actuator/metrics periodically. If any metrics that are being monitored are above the target range, then it would run a new instance.
* Spring Boot allows us to run multiple instances of an application on a single machine by changing the port numbers.
* By providing the Actuator dependency information in pom.xml file and by activating it in the properties file, we can easily set it up.
* The Actuator also provides a mechanism to shut down instances of the application if it is not being used.
* Enabling a discovery server, like Eureka. To add this we would need to Eureka dependency in pom.xml and enable it.
* The next step would be to create a Jenkins pipeline and integrate it with Eureka. It will provide Jenkins with a list of all the instances and the URL.
* By integrating Jenkins with Spring Boot Actuator, it would allow us to access all the metrics exposed by it and we can create a script to scale it up or down based on the number of requests.
